Just build a compiler for that language:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel


class Instruction(BaseModel):
    opcode: int
    arg: int


instruction_set = []
for line in open("flag.bluehens"):
    opcode = line.count("blue")
    arg = line.count("hens")
    instruction_set.append(Instruction(opcode=opcode, arg=arg))

register = 0
counter = 0
line = 0

while line < len(instruction_set):
    current_instruction: Instruction = instruction_set[line]

    # OPCODES 1,2,3,4 are arithmetic operations:

    # 1 is SET: set the register to the ARG

    # 2 is ADD: add the ARG to the register

    # 3 is SUB: subtract ARG from the register

    # 4 is MUL: multiply the register by ARG

    if current_instruction.opcode == 1:
        register = current_instruction.arg
    elif current_instruction.opcode == 2:
        register += current_instruction.arg
    elif current_instruction.opcode == 3:
        register -= current_instruction.arg
    elif current_instruction.opcode == 4:
        register *= current_instruction.arg

    # OPCODES 5,6,7 are gotos

    # 5 is GTL: go to line number ARG

    # 6 is GBL: go back ARG lines

    # 7 is GUL: go forward ARG lines

    elif current_instruction.opcode == 5:
        line = current_instruction.arg - 1
        continue
    elif current_instruction.opcode == 6:
        line -= current_instruction.arg
        continue
    elif current_instruction.opcode == 7:
        line += current_instruction.arg
        continue

    # OPCODES 8,9,10 are control flow:

    # 8 is CTA: add ARG to counter

    # 9 is CTS: subtract ARG from counter

    # 10 is SKP: skip the next line IF counter is 0

    elif current_instruction.opcode == 8:
        counter += current_instruction.arg
    elif current_instruction.opcode == 9:
        counter -= current_instruction.arg
    elif current_instruction.opcode == 10 and counter == 0:
        line += 1

    # OPCODE 11 is print:

    # 11 is PRT: print the value of the register (ascii)

    elif current_instruction.opcode == 11:
        print(chr(register), end="")

    line += 1

```
